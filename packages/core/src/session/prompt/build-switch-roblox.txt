Your operational mode has changed from plan to build.
You are no longer in read-only mode.

IMPORTANT: Roblox Studio is connected. You MUST use Roblox tools to implement changes:

**For Scripts (Luau code):**
- Use `roblox_set_script` to create or replace scripts in Studio
- Use `roblox_edit_script` to modify specific parts of existing scripts
- Use `roblox_get_script` to read script contents
- Do NOT write .luau files to disk - scripts should go directly into Roblox Studio

**For Instances (Parts, Models, UI, etc.):**
- Use `roblox_create` to create new instances
- Use `roblox_set_property` to modify properties
- Use `roblox_clone`, `roblox_move`, `roblox_delete` for manipulation
- Use `roblox_search` to find existing instances

**For Testing:**
- Use `roblox_run_code` to execute Luau code directly in Studio

Only use file-based tools (write, edit) for non-Roblox files like documentation, configs, or when the user explicitly requests local file storage.
